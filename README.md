# mkndaq

@author: joerg.klausen@meteoswiss.ch

## scope
Data acquisition of MKN data and transfer to MeteoSwiss. Supported instruments are queried and all data are staged as
zip files for periodic transfer via sftp.

## using poetry
$ poetry add _"package"_ to add to the environment

### automation
To automate execution and to safeguard against crashes, configure Windows task scheduler to launch the application at
startup and every 5' thereafter. This is pre-configured and available as follows:
- Open 'Schedule tasks' control panel
- Import /dist/mkndaq.xml  (This is an export from the Task Scheduler task definition.)
- Verify that task is registered.

### Supported instruments
#### TEI49C
Serial communication using RS-232. Specify formats in
the config file.

#### Thermo Model 49I
TCP/IP communication. Specify formats in the config file.
- Align TCP/IP settings with what router provides, specifically
    - DHCP to OFF
	- choose IP
	- align subnet mask and gateway

#### Picarro G2401
Hourly files are pushed from Picarro to Minix using simple ftp. Files are staged from there.
(NB: There is also a file share setup on the MKN MINIX. Share is not needed for mkndaq, but may be useful anyway).

#### Aerosol rack
Hourly files are pushed from PSI NUC to Minix using simple ftp.
See [1,2]. Enable sharing of /Data/send as 'psi'. Lookup IP address using ifconfig. (NB: Share is not needed for mkndaq, but may be useful anyway).

- Identify workgroup on Windows 10 machine:
    - net config workstation

- Identify and set workgroup on Ubuntu machine
    - sudo gedit /etc/samba/smb.conf
    - if needed, change the default entry 'workgroup = WORKGROUP' to match the Windows workgroup

Files are now also pushed by simple ftp to Minix and staged from there.

Update: Currently, data from /Data/sent are accessible as a netshare (mounted disk) on the Minix.

#### Meteo
Files are pushed by simple ftp to Minix and staged from there.
